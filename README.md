Fancy Instagram Caption Generator ðŸ“¸âœ¨
Upload your image and get a trendy, Instagram-ready caption! This Streamlit application leverages the power of the Salesforce BLIP model to generate descriptive captions, which are then enhanced with fun emojis, stylish starters, and popular hashtags to give them that extra "fancy" touch.

Features
Intelligent Captioning: Utilizes the BLIP model to understand your image and generate a relevant base caption.
Fancy Enhancements: Automatically adds Instagram-friendly elements like emojis, catchy opening phrases, and trending hashtags.
Easy to Use: Simple drag-and-drop interface for image uploads.
Fast Generation: Get your captions quickly with optimized model loading.
How it Works
Upload an Image: Simply drag and drop your photo into the designated area.
Image Processing: The uploaded image is sent to the BLIP model.
Caption Generation: The BLIP model analyzes the image and produces a descriptive caption.
Fancy Transformation: Our custom make_fancy function then takes this base caption and sprinkles in emojis, cool intros, and relevant hashtags to make it pop!
Display: The generated fancy caption is then displayed, ready for you to copy and paste.
